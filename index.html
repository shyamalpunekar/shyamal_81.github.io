<h2>Benefits of Diversity in the Tech Industry</h2>

  <p>Studies show consistently that the more diverse a company is, the more successful it is. Some of the key benefits are:
<ul>
  <li>Diversity of problem solving tactics</li>
  <li>Awareness of global issues</li>
  <li>Cultural competency and diversity of communication styles</li>
  <li>Smarter and more creative teams</li>
  <li>Company performance improved</li>
  </ul>
      </p>
<p>
The tech industry is growing, but it lacks diversity. Middle school is the age where youth begin to think about career goals, but many diverse youth are turned off from STEM as they grow up.
</p>
<ul>

<li>Girls in particular feel turned off from pursuing STEM careers at age 11 and above</li>
<li>Black and Hispanic students are underrepresented in computer science and engineering programs</li>
</ul>

<p>
<h2>The Tech Industry Needs Your Voice</h2>
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Earn a great income right out of college</li>
  <li>The world is your oyster: find a job anywhere (or work from wherever)</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Make the tech industry more diverse, help the next generation succeed.
